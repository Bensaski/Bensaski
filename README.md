I am a final year student at University of Essex studying Computer Science and Games Development. As a games development student, I am fascinated by the immersion and gameplay experiences games provide to players and aspire to create these experiences myself. As such, my university degree has greatly helped me learn and apply knowledge towards game making and computer science. I am currently searching for post graduate jobs in the Games Industry to kickstart my career!


* Studying at University Of Essex - BSC Computer Games
* Learning C++, Java, Unreal Engine and Unity
* Feel free to reach out to me using my email bensadler27@gmail.com
